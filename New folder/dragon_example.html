<h1>Sparky</h1>
<hr>
<p>A young leviathan-type dragon, just a few months old, that can emit electric shocks from his body. He's 3 and a half feet long and weighs around 30 pounds. His scales are white with hints of blue on the spines and claws, a light beige underbelly, and red eyes. He really likes his privacy, routinely getting aggresive and nipping at caretakers and other dragons who get too close, especially while in the water, but he can be very nice to those who respect his space.</p>
